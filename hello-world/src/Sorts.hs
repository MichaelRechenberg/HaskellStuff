module Sorts

    where

-- a sorted list is a list that has all the values smaller than 
--  (or equal to) the head of the
--  list in front (and those values are sorted), 
--  then comes the head of the list 
--  in the middle and then come all the values that are bigger 
--  than the head (theyâ€™re also sorted).
-- To get head versus tail, we use the (x:xs) pattern

    -- anti-PLOP: we don't care about array indices
    --    or doing any swaps or elements, we just say
    --    ("run quickSort on a list of elements smaller
    --    than x")
    let smallerSorted = quickSort [a | a <- xs, a <= x]
        largerSorted = quickSort [a | a <- xs, a > x]
    -- Here we just say:
    --  * put the elements smaller than x to the left
    --      of x (and have those elems be sorted)
    --  * put the elements larger than x to the right
    --      of x (and have those elems be sorted)
