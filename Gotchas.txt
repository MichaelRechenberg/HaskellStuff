For if/else statements all paths must resolve to the 
  same type of variable.

fizzBuzz xs = [if (x `mod` 3 == 0 && x `mod` 5 == 0) then "FizzBuzz" 
              else if x `mod` 3 == 0 then "Fizz"
              else if x `mod` 15 == 0 then "Buzz"
              else x
              | x <- xs]

This will result in compilation because the 
  else x
part is not a list of chars

Although the above is probably some map function I should write
